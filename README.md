# NationalRail-Watch-App
Does a simple request to the UK's national rail API, and displays specific-destination train info on Apple watch.

This was one of my first iOS projects and is very bespoke. Could be adapted.

Requires a national rail API key to get going. Xcode will prompt for the required variables
